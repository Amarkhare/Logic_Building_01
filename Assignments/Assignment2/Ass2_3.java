#Explaination2 - void is used when a method does not return a value.
		 main method is only meant to start execution not to return 		 result.

#Fixing Error2 - Bracket must be closed
#Fixing Error3 - Replace int with main clear the return statement

#Why is void used in the main method? 
	-void is used when a method does not return a value.
	-main method is only meant to start execution not to return result.
